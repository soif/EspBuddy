- _Tired of typing very long commands to upload your custom firmwares?_
- _Bored to manually upload your firmwares in two steps for 1MB devices?_
- _Want to batch upload new firmwares to all your devices via OTA or backup all settings in one command?_
- _Need a solid tool to discover, control or flash Sonoff DIY devices (ie Sonoff Mini)_

This script allows you to easily upload firmwares to remote (ESP8266 based) devices via Wifi (Over The Air) or Serial, in one short command.
It also gathers various tool commands to be used in batch mode.


## Features

- OTA upload on 4M devices
- OTA upload on 1M devices using an intermediate firmware (automatic two steps)
- Use configuration presets for devices
- Optional compilation using platformio
- Optionally pass various -D flags to the compiler, including extracted parameters like IP or hostname
- Send commands (single or list) to remote devices
- Fetch versions of remote devices
- Archive current firmware & previous firmware per target
- Backup current settings & previous settings per target
- Parse Repositories installed versions
- Git Pull Repositories
- Ping Remote Host
- Sonoff DIY: scan network for devices in DIY mode
- Sonoff DIY: total control using the Ithead factory API.
- Sonoff DIY: replace the factory firmware with any other one (default to Tasmota) OTA. (see [#20](https://github.com/soif/EspBuddy/issues/20) )
- Sonoff DIY: cross-platform support (Mac, Win, Linux)

## Supported Firmwares

Works with :

- [**ESPeasy**](https://github.com/letscontrolit/ESPEasy/)
- [**Espurna**](https://github.com/xoseperez/espurna)
- [**Tasmota**](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/)
- [**Wled**](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/)
- should virtually work with any ESP8266 firmware: *just add a small **espb_repo_xxx** class to describe it.*

## Requirements

- Linux or OSX Operating System (+ [Windows](doc/install_windows.md) for some method only)
- php5 or newer
- PlatformIO __needed only for compiling__

## Installation

- Rename _config-sample.php_ to _config.php_.
- Fill in some hosts and configurations in config.php
